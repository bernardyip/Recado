# Instructions

1. [Download](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AoHrOTRkeXkvgbMsrmvgyQ97_sHgSg) and install SQL Developer
2. Go get the JDBC Driver for your Postgres. We should be using the [current](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html#current) ones.
3. See [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7592519/oracle-sql-developer-and-postgresql) for the remaining instructions to add external libraries (the JDBC driver) for SQL Developer.
4. Once you have successfully connected to your postgres, you can run the [sql script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernardyip/Recado/master/admin%20stuff/SQL%20Developer/pre-alpha-database-setup.sql) to insert some entries.
